# 📊 Student Performance Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes student performance data using Python (Jupyter Notebook), SQL, and data visualization techniques. The goal is to uncover insights about how various factors like gender, lunch type, and parental education affect students’ academic performance.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed in the Jupyter notebook:
- Distribution analysis of scores across subjects.
- Correlation between gender, parental education, lunch type, and test performance.
- Visualization using seaborn and matplotlib (bar plots, box plots, histograms).
- Created a new column: `average_score` to evaluate combined performance.

## 🗄️ SQL-Based Analysis

Key SQL queries in `project2 Sql.sql` include:
- Counting students by grade.
- Grouping students by gender and lunch type to find average performance.
- Identifying the top 10 students based on overall average scores.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Students with **standard lunch** consistently performed better than those with reduced/free lunch.
- **Female students** tended to perform better in reading and writing, while **male students** had slightly higher math scores.
- Parental education levels showed a positive trend with student performance.
